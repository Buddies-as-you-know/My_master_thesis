# Photorealistic 3D Virtual Environment for Robotics

## Overview
This repository contains the LaTeX source code for the thesis titled "Photorealistic 3D Virtual Environment for Robot Navigation and Manipulation using Neural Radiance Fields and Unreal Engine 5" by Yuminosuke Sato. The thesis presents a novel approach to creating photorealistic 3D virtual environments for robotics, leveraging Luma AI's Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Unreal Engine 5 (UE5). It demonstrates a cost-effective and efficient pipeline for generating these environments using standard smartphone cameras.

## Key Features
- **Photorealistic 3D Environment Creation**: Utilizes Luma AI's NeRF and UE5 for creating highly realistic 3D virtual environments.
- **Robotics Integration**: Deployment of Turtlebot3 robot in virtual environments for testing navigation and object recognition capabilities.
- **Efficient Pipeline**: Demonstrates reduced time and resources in environment creation compared to traditional methods like NeRF2real and Matterport3D.
- **Object Recognition Analysis**: Uses YOLOX for object recognition, comparing performance in real and virtual environments.
- **Navigation Technology Evaluation**: Explores the use of Navigation2 technology within these virtual environments.
